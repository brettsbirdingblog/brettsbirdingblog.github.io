                Sitting here listening to "Paul" - Big Thief while I code, having such a wonderful time!
                The song is so so beautiful and it reminds me of my lovely girlfriend Maggie! (if you're
                reading this, I LOVE YOU!)

                I've made a lot of progress today on the site. Yesterday it was very barebones, but now
                there are exciting features. I still need to do code clean-up and UI graphic design stuff
                or whatever to make the site look more (less) in development...

                Here's a cool shot from earlier in the day when the lighting was better, looks pretty
                cozy to me!

                It feels nice to be excited about a random personal project again... Last time I really
                felt like this was at UBC when I was working on the SRCNN youtube series. Check that out below
                if you're curious! I'm working on the final episode currently.

                Literally the arrangement of those videos above took me like 30-45mins dang... Whatever, it was worth
                it. They were fun videos to make and I look forward to making more videos in the future. Hoping to 
                make a video about this site and how you can make your own! Anyway, I justed wanted to pop in for 
                a short (mid-dev) entry for history's sake.
