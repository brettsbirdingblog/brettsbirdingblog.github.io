            <h1>An Interesting Day.</h1>
            <h2>05/21/25 - 11:33 PM</h2>
            <p>
                Today I had to make a very difficult decision and it took a lot from me. 
                That's all I'll get into though, some things are meant to be kept private.
                Regardless I will be doing lots of reflecting and learning.
            </p>

                On a different note, here is a Crow attacking a Bald Eagle that I 
                photographed off of my porch!
            </p>

                I have recently been really enjoying coding and am working on the next
                installment of my fun super-resolution YouTube series... It has me learning
                a lot of new things, and I am really excited to share it with everyone soon!
                Working on projects is the most fulfilling thing for me, I really want to 
                lean into this and put a lot of energy and effort into creating fun and 
                interesting stuff for both my own curiosity and for other's too!
            </p>
            <p>
                On that note, here are some fun bird drawings I made this evening,
                the first is a silly Wren made from a fun spiral style and the other
                is a more rough sketch style Osprey!
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="assets/wren.jpg" style="display: inline-block;
                width: 40%;
                vertical-align: top;
                margin-right: 2%">
            <img src="assets/osprey.jpg" style="display: inline-block;
                            width: 40%;
                            vertical-align: top;
                            margin-right: 2%">
            </div>
            <p>
                I have been having a lot of fun drawing recently and have 
                even started making my own stickers! My first order comes 
                this Friday, I can't wait to see how they turned out.
                I probably should have invested slightly less money, $140
                for my first order (3 designs, 20 stickers each) may have 
                been a bit much, but I'm excited regardless.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm just ending the night with some chill 'coding' which
                is actually just making this journal entry... and am ready
                for some sleep soon. I need to rest, my mind has been going
                through a lot lately. Hoping for a happy and healthy night 
                and a beautiful day for everyone tomorrow!
            </p>
            <p>
                Bye!
