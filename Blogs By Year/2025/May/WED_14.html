    <h1>New Camera Day!</h1>
    <h2>05/14/25</h2>
    <p>I technically got the camera yesterday, but today was my 
       first day using and testing it out! It's a relatively unused 
       Nikon D7000 I purchased on FB Marketplace. I paired it with 
       a vintage Nikon 85-250mm film lens I was gifted by a coworker.</p>
