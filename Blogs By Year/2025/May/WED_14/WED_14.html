               I technically got the camera yesterday, but today was my 
               first day using and testing it out! It's a relatively unused 
               Nikon D7000 I purchased on FB Marketplace for $275. I paired it with 
               a vintage Nikon 85-250mm film lens I was gifted by a coworker.

               I went out for an evening walk today to test out the rig and I had 
               a really great time! I saw an adult and juvinile American Robin perch together.

                I saw a couple other birds while I was out but really it was about testing the 
                camera and getting used to working only with manual settings. Since the lens is retro,
                there are no auto features and so the only setting I can essentially use is Manual
                mode.

                I'm hoping this will force me to gain an understanding of balancing ISO, aperature,
                and shutter speed to get a desireable photo.

                Anyway, the idea behind this blog is to have an outlet to reflect on adventures
                and random stuff about life and my experiences and hobbies.

            <p>
                Have a great day!
            </p>
